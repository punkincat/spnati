    <othernotes>Personal History:&lt;br&gt;Toph Beifong is the sole daughter of the Beifong estate, one of the richest families in the Earth Kingdom. Blind from birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual impairment and was sheltered from the world by her overprotective parents. Upon discovering badgermoles, blind animals that can earthbend--telekinetically manipulate, reshape, and control stone, sand, and dirt--Toph learned how to earthbend and use bending as an extension of her senses. This gives her the ability to "see" everything on the ground--locating objects and their movements by sensing their vibrations in the earth around her.&lt;br&gt;At a young age, she started sneaking out of her home to compete as "The Blind Bandit" in Earth Rumbles, professional wrestling-esque earthbending tournaments. This attracted the attention of Avatar Aang, and although initially uninterested in helping Aang, she eventually ran away from home and joined him as his earthbending teacher. She became a prodigy of bending, a skilled fighter and even learned how to bend metal, being the first bender to do so. After the war ended, she opened up her own metalbending academy in which she trains other people to become better earthbenders, and still occasionally helps out Aang and his friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Targeting Notes:&lt;br&gt;Toph is very proud of her earthbending abilities and has a highly competitive spirit. She is unique for her total mastery of the element, which leads to her method of approaching things head-on; however, she is absolutely clueless when it comes to anything that is not on the ground. So she does not understand colors or writing, and cannot sense anything that's floating above the ground as opposed to standing on it.&lt;br&gt;Toph is a tomboy with a blunt and abrasive personality. She is very open and forward; she doesn't hide her feelings and she's never afraid to offer rough insight. Some may even see her as a hardass or a jerk. She does have a soft side, though, and is very open to compliments. Expect playful flirty bullying from her.&lt;br&gt;This depiction of Toph is 18-22, so between the most recent (as of 2022) Avatar comics and The Legend of Korra.&lt;br&gt;Since she is unable to see herself, Toph is still somewhat insecure about how she looks. Not as much as in the show--she isn't SUPER upset by it, and is mostly confident about her appearance--but it's a slight sore spot and she can have moments of doubt.&lt;br&gt;Toph is fairly open to relationships and to trying new things. She is somewhat familiar with romance--she's had a relationship before (that's about as ambiguous as I'm leaving it). She is very sex-positive, and she is okay with both brief flings and longer relationships. I'm writing her as bi-curious--she hasn't been with any women before but is open to the possibility of it.&lt;br&gt;Some things Toph can talk about: Her friends (particularly Aang, Katara, and Sokka), her school, earth/metalbending, fighting, her wealthy background, her blindness, and her competitive nature--not just for this but for other activities as well.</othernotes>

        <line>Well, I like hanging with Sokka, and the rest of Team Avatar as well--Katara, Aang, Zuko, all of them! But since I stared running the Academy, I barely get any chances to spend much time with them, except when there's a battle to be fought. (Resp. to NadeshikoFriends, for the Removing Accessory case, or the Any Hand case if it's moved to it)</line>
