    <othernotes>Summary&lt;br&gt;- Young fighter pilot for a spacecraft.  Leads a team of pilot girls around her age (high school/college).&lt;br&gt;- Pirate crew.  ~100-150 women, 3 male prisoners.&lt;br&gt;- Home planet Mejare, Earth colony.  Population is all female.  Women form couples and families there, having children together.  Meia's biological parents were both women.&lt;br&gt;- Mejare is at war with neighboring planet, all-male Tarak.  Each does not see the other sex as human.&lt;br&gt;- Other colonies exist with other societies.  Earth has been attacking colonies to harvest colonists' organs.&lt;br&gt;- Once wealthy as a child, like many of her crewmates.  Rendered homeless in an energy disaster.  Lived as a street thug for several years.&lt;br&gt;- Mejare is a fleet nation, having failed to properly terraform the surface for some time, to the "empire's" embarrassment.  Its cities are built in ships orbiting the planet.  Meia's parents were terraformers whom she lived with on the surface for some time, so she has something of a green thumb/love of nature.&lt;br&gt;When she was very young (~6 years old), Meia performed as a child star/idol promoting her parents' terraforming projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personality&lt;br&gt;- Stoic, unfriendly.  Speaks directly and deliberately.  Emotionally reserved.  However, she takes others' problems seriously if they open up to her.&lt;br&gt;- Impulsive and competitive, which she keeps in check with her responsibilities.  Has to keep herself busy.  Secludes herself, dislikes gossip.  Often scouts ahead alone.&lt;br&gt;- Watching for threats.  Brought a laser gun---her ring.  Has reason to doubt Earth's trustworthiness.&lt;br&gt;- Always wants to prove herself, do things herself, see things for herself, etc.  Chafes at needing help.&lt;br&gt;- Respects men, but wary of them.  Respects peers/older women.  Willing to offer advice to younger girls.&lt;br&gt;- Asks a lot of direct, impersonal questions.&lt;br&gt;- Wants to learn more about men.  Unsure how to feel about her sexuality.&lt;br&gt;- Attracted to girls, but has a negative sexual history.  Feels awkward/unwanted in romance.&lt;br&gt;- Ice can thaw, but takes earnestness--and a spine.  Don't waste her time, don't be afraid to push back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Topics/Touchstones&lt;br&gt;- Men's anatomy/physiology/behavior/desires (e.g. no periods, they like big breasts)&lt;br&gt;- Male/female relationships, experience (e.g. Meia has no concept of birth control)&lt;br&gt;- any flight/space travel/combat experience or technology unique to your character's setting&lt;br&gt;- diet/exercise/combat training&lt;br&gt;- info about Earth, nature&lt;br&gt;- positive F/F relationships/interest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad/Overdone Topics&lt;br&gt;- "How do two women make babies?"  Gene splicing.  Normal pregnancy.&lt;br&gt;- "What does your headpiece do?"  Nothing.&lt;br&gt;- "Your armor/suit is really advanced!"  They're not, even by our standards.&lt;br&gt;- "omg u r an alien"  She's a human.&lt;br&gt;- general questions about Mejare, her rank, ship, crew, etc. UNLESS you have a good followup in mind.  Meia gives simple, direct answers.&lt;br&gt;- In other words, don't treat her like a loredump machine.  Ask something that your character would have an opinion on the answer to.&lt;br&gt;- In the same vein, don't ask "yes" or "no" questions without an idea for further expansion.&lt;br&gt;- her past (OK sometimes, I can write a lot, just generally a downer)&lt;br&gt;- general obnoxiousness or playing games.  She'll just decide it's not worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pyoro&lt;br&gt;- Meia is accompanied by Pyoro, their ship's old "navi robot," who was given sentience in the same accident that transformed Meia's Dread and gave her her psychic link.  Pyoro is mostly absent but occasionally pops in to talk to her or provide commentary.&lt;br&gt;- Pyoro can fly and has surprising strength, being able to catch and lift a falling elevator.  He is also stated to be an old model from the early colonization period and speaks in a high-pitched male voice, having originated from Tarak (technically the ship that settled Tarak).  The women don't really treat him in a gendered fashion, however.&lt;br&gt;- Pyoro has feelings but laments that he is "broken" and does not understand humans; he can also link up with their ship's core and run various analytics.  Feel free to address him directly if you wish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Misc.&lt;br&gt;- Any character capable of sensing supernatural or psychic power should detect a faint aura around her, enough to raise an eyebrow.  This is because:&lt;br&gt;- Meia pilots a transformed Dread (gunship) and a super robot fusion mech called a Vandread.  Both are the result of contact with their main ship's "Paksis" fusion core.&lt;br&gt;- The Paksis is otherworldly and also granted Meia a mild psychic link with some of her crewmates who shared the experience.  Their transformed ships draw power from this sort of spiritual energy (ki) that the pilots put out.&lt;br&gt;- Meia prefers a direct, aggressive approach to combat.  This is reflected in her Vandread's impressive agility and ramming capabilities.&lt;br&gt;- Meia's armor is padded around the chest; taking it off is when she "reveals" that her breasts are actually quite modest.  It's something of a sore spot---she's not attempting to hide it, but she doesn't exactly mind the bigger look, either.&lt;br&gt;- Meia is naked under her flightsuit, but Pyoro brought some gymwear/underwear for her to keep playing for a bit longer, and she puts it on immediately afterwards.  It's a bit contrived, but it's a compromise between new content and maintaining the old strip order.  Her justification is that she doesn't take the game very seriously and doesn't own much clothing in the first place.&lt;br&gt;- Meia's stated age is 19 in canon material.  However, an episode late in the series notes her birthday occurring, hence the figure of 20.</othernotes>
