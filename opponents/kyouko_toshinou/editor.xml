    <othernotes>FYI: If you want to target her outfit, be wary of future costumes. Especially her underwear—it won't always have a tomato pattern, nor can I guarantee it'll always be on the same layer. I'm using a bunch of markers so you can target them instead of her stage and/or costume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personality:&lt;br&gt;- Energetic. Excitable and has an active imagination.&lt;br&gt;- Pushy. Often assumes others think similiarly to herself, and overly aggressive when trying to make friends.&lt;br&gt;- Confident. Talks big about herself or her own skills to try to get a reaction.&lt;br&gt;- Selfish. Will think about others, but only after she's served herself.&lt;br&gt;- Strange. Enjoys anything unusual and takes great pleasure in subverting others' expectations.&lt;br&gt;- Lazy. Willing to give up at a moment's notice unless it's something she really cares about.&lt;br&gt;- Horny. She's here to see others naked, and getting naked herself is a means to that end.&lt;br&gt;- Observant. Usually won't tell you, but she notices more than she lets on.&lt;br&gt;- Reliable. Sometimes, when she isn't joking.&lt;br&gt;- Easygoing. Despite her energy, she isn't truly fazed by much. One of the few things that does bother her is realizing that someone truly dislikes her.&lt;br&gt;- Enjoys teasing and confusing others to get a rise out of them. Uses a lot of bait-and-switch humor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Useful info:&lt;br&gt;- Naturally assumes the boke/funny guy role of a manzai duo.&lt;br&gt;- Jokes often involve misleading the others or outright lying to them.&lt;br&gt;- Runs a doujin circle at Comuket dedicated to "Witch Girl Mirakurun," her favorite anime/manga, under the pen name Ramuko Nishikyogoku.&lt;br&gt;- Skilled at arts and crafts, both normal things like modelling clay and weird things like cutting designs into apple skins.&lt;br&gt;- Big eater. Easy to please with food and will eat almost anything.&lt;br&gt;- Her favorite food is rum raisin, a flavor of ice cream.&lt;br&gt;- The Amusement Club originally consisted of herself and her friends Yui, Akari, and Chinatsu, but now includes the student council of the time: Ayano, Chitose, Sakurako, and Himawari.&lt;br&gt;- Had a stolen clubroom in middle school, but not since then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made a bunch of markers for lines I didn't feel were worth a situation but could be targeted anyway if you so choose. Most of these are prefixed with D, Q, or S.</othernotes>

            <description>Kyouko lied earlier about taking off her ribbon. An observant character may have gotten suspicious because of how often she brought it up. (this only happens in her default outfit)</description>

        <note id="5">The marker is available so other characters can see which uniform she's wearing just in case they absolutely need to know for whatever reason. FYI, it's always unset when she loses the red dress.

That said, do not use this specifically for an interaction. There's a reason I didn't make a situation for it.</note>
        <note id="45">Switching back to her right hand here was intentional.

Also, this is global because an opponent masturbating line somehow snuck in between this line and the one that was supposed to precede it.</note>
        <note id="49">I refuse to elaborate on why the scope is lying.</note>
        <note id="57">kinda wish 2D and 3D art had separate tags cuz this is kinda hard when I can't assume the target draws a lot</note>
        <note id="63">Kyouko will try to fix her hair literally the next case after "Finished (Self)" plays. This and the game ending should be the only things that interrupt that in order to prevent inconsistency.</note>
        <note id="83">Kyoko says she keeps her ribbon on (and sets the same marker) in a few other cases, but this one is the most reliable.
Yes, there are two markers for this. Feel free to target whichever you like.</note>
        <note id="158">In case it doesn't come through, she's trying to mislead him</note>
        <note id="95">You could target this if you wanted your character to immediately notice the pattern on her panties. As far as making that future-proof, though, here be dragons.</note>
        <note id="179">These stripping/stripped lines are pretty much placeholders so the dialogue ties into what Kyouko just said. Feel free to ignore them with Nagatoro and continue the conversation instead.</note>
        <note id="180">Placeholder to give Nagatoro time to respond. I just wrote this so her sequence makes sense with context from the Must Strip case</note>
        <note id="317">These *should* always get out-prioritized, but I'm not perfect so who knows?</note>
        <note id="341">I'll come back for the other line later. I decided I could at least respond to one since I know where I could go from here.</note>
        <note id="403">Yes, these are mixed in with the usual opponent masturbating lines.</note>
        <note id="404">Yes, these are mixed in with the usual opponent masturbating lines.</note>
        <note id="453">If I could include moe I would, but I'm not sure how to get the conditions to work out where any of blonde, small_breasts, or moe counts for this. I'm kinda just leaning on moe+!short+!small_breasts being rare</note>
        <note id="454">If I could include moe I would, but I'm not sure how to get the conditions to work out where any of blonde, small_breasts, or moe counts for this. I'm kinda just leaning on moe+!short+!small_breasts being rare</note>
