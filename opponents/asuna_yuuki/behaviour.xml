My boyfriend and I use them to deflect bullets... it kinda makes us famous, because no one else can figure out how.</state>
                <state img="#-exasperated.png" oneShotId="37" weight="0.75">Most of my friends and I got into GGO, another virtual game, rather late... my boyfriend didn't, because he dove head-first into a dangerous situation, &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;. I get that's who Kirito is, but he really worried us!</state>
                <state img="#-think.png" oneShotId="38" weight="0.75">&lt;i&gt;(Without GGO's bullet-assist system, I'm not sure Kazuto and I would be able to deflect bullets in-game. After all, we kinda just predict the predictive paths... or that's how my boyfriend puts it.)&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-overjoyed.png" oneShotId="39" weight="0.75">Watching the Bullet of Bullet game tournament in GGO was fun, even with what went on behind-the-scenes. I just hope me and my friends might try the next one, whenever that is.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="40" marker="ordinal_scale" weight="0.75">Since Ordinal Scale is an augmented game, only the players perceive any changes. To passersby though, we might look rather silly, moving around and attacking invisible things.</state>

                <state img="#-overjoyed.png" oneShotId="43" weight="0.75">Rather than levels, we have rankings in the Ordinal Scale game; the higher, the better of course. But of course skill is still very important.</state>
