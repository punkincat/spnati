If Nagisa to left and Meia to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES AND ANY MALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_not_all_girls]: Oh, it's me already. Okay. I can do this. Even if... even if it's not just girls here. One step at a time...
Meia [nagisa0left]: ...Did something happen between you and a man, Nagisa?  I figured Earth girls would be comfortable around them.
  OR [nagisa0left]: ...Are you worried about men?  I thought you lived together with them on this planet.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) AND ANY MALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_undressing_men]: Oh, no, it's nothing like that. And I'm sure everyone here is lovely. It's just that, um, men and women don't usually undress for each other. Unless they're in love...
Meia [nagisa01left]: ...So even here, there's boundaries.  I guess I pictured both genders climbing in a bath together without a second thought.
  OR [nagisa01left]: ...So you wouldn't share a hot spring, for instance.  I guess there's <i>some</i> instinct for separation.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) AND ANY MALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_mixed_bathing]: Mixed bathing?! Ah, no, we don't really do that. Or at least, I think there are some places you <i>can</i> do that, but I've never been to one.
Meia []: ...It's strange.  We can trust our lives to each other, but it's still uncomfortable trusting our bodies.
  OR []: We must be born that way.  Our doctor's saved my life, but I blushed when he saw me walking towards the hot spring.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES AND ALL FEMALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_all_girls_table]: Isn't it nice how we can play this game with just us girls? I'm glad I didn't get put on to a table with any boys on it. I almost did, and my heart was racing so much!
Meia [nagisa0left_f]: I'm not sure <i>how</i> to feel.  This is easier, but I wanted to see a man's body for myself.
  OR [nagisa0left_f]: I was hoping to play with a man, actually.  Our ship already has secondhand rumors floating around.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) AND ALL FEMALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_curious_too]: I have to admit I'm also a little curious, Meia. But remember that he would get to see you too. And that's way too embarrassing!
Meia [nagisa01left_f]: ...It <i>is</i> embarrassing, but that's why I want to face it.  You have to take your fears head-on.
  OR [nagisa01left_f]: I wish I could say it didn't embarrass me.  But getting scared off by that would be even worse.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) AND ALL FEMALES PRESENT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_hard_enough]: I know you're right. Still, I think to~background.time~ will be hard enough as it is.
Meia []: Maybe it's my homeworld talking, but you get used to stripping around other girls pretty quickly.
  OR []: Have you never been nude around other girls?  Mejare's not shy about that, and our crew even less so.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_dad_protective]: I'll let you know right away if I see my dad. He's really protective of me, so I'll stall him as much as possible to give you a headstart on your escape!
Meia [nagisa1left]: ...That's your male parent, right?  Are men usually like that with their daughters?
  OR [nagisa1left]: ..."Dad" means the man in your family, right?  I haven't really pictured them as parents.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_dad_overboard]: I don't think everyone goes as overboard as my dad. But he's just trying to keep me safe, so please don't hold it against him!
Meia [nagisa12left]: I've seen a man challenge one who was triple his size, and that was to protect a girl he loved.  I can only imagine him with his children.
  OR [nagisa12left]: The men <i>I</i> know can go overboard.  They'll throw away their lives to protect their partners, let alone their children.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_not_a_kid]: Sure, it makes me feel special, but I don't think he realizes that I can take care of myself now. I'm not a kid anymore.
Meia []: As reckless as they can be, it's kind of flattering.  They've even gone out of their way for <i>me</i> sometimes.
  OR []: Sometimes it's more stupidity than bravery.  And I don't like accepting help myself...but when they care that much, it's hard not to appreciate it.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_teams]: Wouldn't be more fun if we could play in teams? Or maybe we could all be on the same team.
Meia [nagisa2left]: We'd still compete with each other.  I did everything I could to stand out on the Dread team.
  OR [nagisa2left]: Even on a team, there's competition.  I wanted to be our best pilot from the day I joined.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_family_stand_out]: Maybe I'm thinking more like a family, where everyone supports each other. Everybody is different, but nobody has to stand out, you know?
Meia [nagisa23left]: We're even <i>called</i> Magno's Family.  It's not about others--I just want to prove myself.
  OR [nagisa23left]: A crew is a lot <i>like</i> family.  I'm not trying to upstage them, I just--want to prove <i>I</i> exist.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_the_nest]: I think I understand. You're not that much older than me, Meia, so even though you love your family, you want to leave the nest sometimes just to make sure you can fly.
Meia []: I was on my own for a long time already.  What I worry about now is that I'll die, and it'll be like I never lived at all.
  OR []: I already got pushed out of "the nest."  Now, it's more like...I want to pass something on to the future.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_friendship]: Oh. It's me. Um, I know that is probably the worst time to be making friends, but I'd like to be friends with you all if you'll let me. I'm not very good at this, but I just wanted to say that while I was still, um... clothed, you know?
Meia [nagisa3left]: We've just met each other.  Friendships take time and effort.
  OR [nagisa3left]: That's not something we can just <i>decide.</i>  Friendships have to grow.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_rambling]: O-Okay. We don't have to be friends right away or anything. It's just easier to go through hard things with friends rather than strangers, right? Or maybe going through hard things together is how strangers become friends. I don't really have many friends, so I'm not sure. S-Sorry if I'm rambling, but I'm just kind of anxious...
Meia [nagisa34left]: Hard times are <i>exactly</i> how you make friends.  If this game's hard for you, then maybe we'll bond by the end.
  OR [nagisa34left]: I don't have many friends, either.  But hard times are the only way I've ever made them.  Let's start with this game.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_good_attitude]: That's such a good attitude to have. Okay. Let's all do our best.
Meia []: That's all anyone can ask of you.
  OR []: That's what we tell recruits.  We want their best, whatever it is.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_not_running]: I won't run away. I have to take this challenge head on!
Meia [nagisa4left]: That's a good attitude.  It's the one <i>I've</i> always had, and I've learned a lot about myself from it.
  OR [nagisa4left]: ...That's always been my approach to things.  You'll learn who you really are.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_underthinking]: I've already decided, so I'll do it for sure! If I think about it too much, I might not be able to go through with it!
Meia [nagisa45left]: ...That's true, too.  If you keep this up, you might be able to make it as a pilot.
  OR [nagisa45left]: Where'd you suddenly get this nerve?  It's what makes a great pilot.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_pilot]: If this is what it takes to be a pilot, I don't know if I'm cut out for it...
Meia []: You've got people to go back to.  But that determination will keep you strong, no matter what.
  OR []: Summoning that courage is what counts.  But you've got other places to go besides our crew.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_life_offworld]: I'm happy to hear that there's life on other planets, because I might have to move there forever after this...
Meia [nagisa5left]: There's only life there because we terraformed them, Nagisa.
  OR [nagisa5left]: It's not in the way you think, Nagisa.  They're all colonies terraformed by Earth people.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_hills]: Oh, I see. Maybe we could've appreciated those planets' natural beauty without changing everything. Everybody loves mountains, but sometimes hills can be pretty too... right? I hope.
Meia [nagisa56left]: We can't escape being human.  What we need to live, or--our own insecurities.
  OR [nagisa56left]: I guess even something like embarrassment can follow us through space.  It's as human as needing air.

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_here_i_am]: Meia's right. There's nowhere I could go to run away from myself. S-So... h-here I am still.
Meia []: Pushing past embarrassment always clears my head.
  OR []: ...Be honest with yourself, and don't run away.  That's what I try to live by now.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_arm_here]: Oh! Um... W-Would anybody mind if I kept my arm right here? It would really mean a lot to me, and anyway I'm sure you don't get excited when you see a girl's... um... her downstairs area. At least not when it's a girl like me...
Meia [nagisa6left]: ...Where I'm from, we <i>do</i> get excited.  But it's not always about your body--it's about the trust you have to let others see it.
  OR [nagisa6left]: ...Don't you trust us by now?  For a lot of girls I know, that's what this really means.  You trust them enough to show yourself.

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_trust]: Y-Yeah... I <i>can</i> trust you, right?<br>I'll... <i>I'll be in your care, then!</i>
Meia [nagisa67left]: Huh?  O-oh...uh, right.
  OR [nagisa67left]: U-uh...s-sure.

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_hug_circumstances]: I can't believe I actually did it... That might be the toughest thing I've ever done, but nobody's here to give me a hug. But considering the circumstances... that's probably for the best.
Meia [nagisa7s_left]: ...I can give a hug.
  OR [nagisa7s_left]: ...I wouldn't mind that.

NAGISA BEING DEALT HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_hug_sure]: Are you sure?
Meia [nagisa_cardswap]: Come here.
  OR [nagisa_cardswap]: It's fine.

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTIES (meia said [nagisa7s_left]) {HUG}
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_hugging]*: ~silent~ / no image
Meia [nagisa_hug]*: ~silent~


NAGISA MUST MASTURBATE FIRST AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug])
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_first_loss, nagisa_play]: You don't know how much that meant to me, Meia. If even someone I just met can show me such kindness, maybe in return I can show you... my play.
Meia [nagisa_hug_postnagisafirstloss, unaware_mast]: ...Your play?  As in---well, it's a rule we have to "play with ourselves," right...?
  OR [nagisa_hug_postnagisafirstloss, unaware_mast]: ...P-play as in---like, mouth play?  I'd heard that was a rule for when we lost, to---<i>masturbate.</i>

NAGISA MUST MASTURBATE AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug])
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_loss]: Th-Thank you, Meia. I needed that more than I realized. So much that I wasn't really looking at my cards... Well, now that I'm out, I just have to remember: Everybody's rooting for me.
Meia [nagisa_hug_postnagisaloss]: I would've felt bad watching you push others away.  Someone taught me that not too long ago.  <br>...Go ahead and enjoy yourself.
  OR [nagisa_hug_postnagisaloss]: Saying no one cared about you, and that it was better that way...that sounded a lot like <i>me.</i>  <br>...Don't worry about losing.

OPPONENT MUST STRIP AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug]):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_other]: Sorry, ~name~, but I have to tell Meia something just quickly. I... I... Um... Th-thank you. Thank you for helping me keep my mind off things when they were at their hardest.
Meia [nagisa_hug_postother]: Don't let that be the hardest thing you ever do, Nagisa.  I think you're capable of a lot more.
  OR [nagisa_hug_postother]: Keep finding new hardest things, Nagisa.  Maybe it's just me, but I get a rush from it.

PLAYER MUST STRIP AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug]):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_other]*: Sorry, ~name~, but I have to tell Meia something just quickly. I... I... Um... Th-thank you. Thank you for helping me keep my mind off things when they were at their hardest.
Meia [nagisa_hug_postother]: Don't let that be the hardest thing you ever do, Nagisa.  I think you're capable of a lot more.
  OR [nagisa_hug_postother]: Keep finding new hardest things, Nagisa.  Maybe it's just me, but I get a rush from it.

MEIA MUST STRIP AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug])
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_strip]: I really appreciate what you just did for me, Meia. The hug, I mean. Not losing the hand. Unless... you didn't do that for me too, did you?
Meia [nagisa_hug_postloss]: ...No, I didn't.  It's really not like me to take a hit for someone else...outside of a Dread, anyway.
  OR [nagisa_hug_postloss]: <i>Ahaha...</i>don't flatter yourself.  I hate losing, even to my crewmates.  It's just... sometimes it's worth it.

MEIA MUST MASTURBATE FIRST AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug])
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_protect]: You've been so nice to me to~background.time~, Meia. Even though you're just as exposed as I am, you're still willing to go this far to protect me. You're... You're amazing!
Meia [nagisa_hug_postforfeitfirst, unaware_mast]: ...For <i>that?</i>  Ahaha...well, this is a blow to my <i>pride.</i>  And the rule is losers have to go even further, right?
  OR [nagisa_hug_postforfeitfirst, unaware_mast]: ...It was just a hug.  But it looks like I paid the price for it.  And now---I'm supposed to touch <i>myself,</i> right?

MEIA MUST MASTURBATE AFTER HUG (meia said [nagisa_hug])
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_post-hug_skinship]: Th-Thank you, Meia. I've never had that kind skinship with a stranger before... Oh no, did I distract you too much! I'm really sorry if you lost because of me.
Meia [nagisa_hug_postforfeit]: Tch.  That's what I get for not paying attention.  <br>...It's not your fault, Nagisa.  In fact, I'd call this mission a success---once I climax.
  OR [nagisa_hug_postforfeit]: ...No good deed goes unpunished.  At least, if you're competing...don't worry about it, Nagisa.  I have plenty to report on either way---maybe a bit more in a moment.

---

MEIA MUST STRIP HEADPIECE:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_astronaut]: You look really cool, Meia. Are you an astronaut?
Meia [nagisa_astronaut]: "Cool"?  <br>...I pilot an assault craft for a pirate crew, Nagisa.  Astronauts aren't fighters.
  OR [nagisa_astronaut]: ..."Astronaut" is more for explorers, Nagisa.  I'm on an attack squad.
  OR [nagisa_astronaut]: Uh...I'm part of an assault team, Nagisa.  Astronauts are scientists.
  OR [nagisa_astronaut]: ...Thank you, Nagisa, but astronauts are peaceful.  I'm a fighter pilot.

MEIA STRIPPING HEADPIECE (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_star_wars]: Oh, sorry for getting it wrong. I learned that everyone who goes up into space is an astronaut. But I don't know much about star wars kinds of stuff.
Meia [nagisa_resp01]: I think this time is before Earth settled other colonies.  Everyone in space <i>would</i> be an explorer.
  OR [nagisa_resp01]: ...In this time, that might be true.  It seems like Earth hasn't expanded to other planets yet.

MEIA STRIPPED HEADPIECE (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_moon_landing]: We might not have travelled to other planets, but we landed on the moon. I think that's a pretty good effort.
Meia []: ...This is further back than I thought.
  OR []: ...The big one, right nearby?  This must be <i>ancient</i> history.


MEIA MUST STRIP EYEPATCH IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_cupid_whole_set]: The saleslady at the lingerie store tried to get me to buy the whole angel intimate set too, but I couldn't afford the wings. Are you here to impress someone special, Meia?
Meia [nagisa_resp0cupid]: That's not it, Nagisa.  I just figured it'd be nice to celebrate a holiday for once instead of secluding myself.
  OR [nagisa_resp0cupid]: It's not to <i>impress</i> anyone, Nagisa.  It's just to socialize.  I always go off alone when the crew celebrates something.

MEIA STRIPPING EYEPATCH (accessory) IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_cupid_dream]: That's so bold! I'm sure you'll find someone to celebrate with. I've never been to an event in just my underwear before, except in a bad dream one time...
Meia [nagisa_resp01cupid]: I can be with my crewmates later to~background.time~.  Besides, this is still more modest than some of their clothes.
  OR [nagisa_resp01cupid]: I'm sure the crew's organizing their Valentine's party, and picking out even skimpier clothes.  I'll join up with them later.

MEIA STRIPPED EYEPATCH (accessory) IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_cupid_angels]: I hope your crewmates could at least afford both the underwear parts of the set. They wouldn't want to give angels a bad reputation.
Meia []: Where I'm from, the more beauty you show, the better.  That goes for angels, too.
  OR []: Mejare's idea of angels is just gorgeous girls.  And you're not gorgeous unless you <i>show</i> how gorgeous you are.


MEIA MUST STRIP ARMOR:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_blue_hair]: Your hair is such a nice blue sky color, Meia. One of my best friends has blue hair, but he's a boy and it's more like an ocean blue.
Meia [nagisa_resp1bluehair]: Uh--Nagisa, I'm not sure what a "boy" is.  Like, a man our age?
  OR [nagisa_resp1bluehair]: ...Your hair is nice, too, Nagisa.  Is a "boy" a girl in your class, or...a man?
  OR [nagisa_resp1bluehair]: ...You don't need to pay me compliments, Nagisa.  <br>"Boy" means a man, right?
  OR [nagisa_resp1bluehair]: ...Thank you, Nagisa.  I'm not sure what you mean, though.  "Boy" is like--"girl" for men?

MEIA STRIPPING ARMOR (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_cute_boy]: Oh, um, a "boy" is a young man. They're so cute when they're little, and... and some of them are cute when they're older too.
Meia [nagisa_resp12]: ..."Cute" the way you'd call your girlfriend cute?  Maybe if you went to school with men instead of fighting them...
  OR [nagisa_resp12]: Most of the ones I've met were soldiers.  I guess civilian men could be cute.

MEIA STRIPPED ARMOR (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_boy_smiles]: It's really nice when a handsome boy in uniform smiles at you, but I don't know if soldiers are allowed to smile.
Meia []: Apparently our prisoners didn't used to smile much before they met us.  The same goes for me.
  OR []: Tarak does seem depressing, even on the surface.  None of our prisoners have fond memories of it.

MEIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED ARMOR IN DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_suit_skin]: Meia, I was just wondering... I don't see any zippers or anything on your wetsuit. Unless that's your skin... I'm so sorry if that's your skin and I didn't notice! I didn't mean to offend you!
Meia [nagisa_nudesuit]: ...It's a flightsuit, Nagisa.  There's just nothing underneath.
  OR [nagisa_nudesuit]: It's a suit, Nagisa.  Most of the Dread pilots wear one.  I brought my underwear separate.


MEIA MUST STRIP BODYSUIT IN DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nm_m7]: Your turn again, Meia. I'm not sure what your plan is now, but you don't seem worried, so I'll leave everything to you.
Meia [nagisa_resp2]: I don't really <i>plan</i> too much, Nagisa.  I just use my instincts.
  OR [nagisa_resp2]: Half my plans are on the spot, Nagisa.

MEIA STRIPPING BODYSUIT (temporary breast reveal) IN DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nm_m8]: Ah! There's... there's really nothing under there. I thought you were just kidding around before...
Meia [nagisa_resp23]: ...You thought I was <i>kidding around?</i>
  OR [nagisa_resp23]: That sounds more like what you <i>wanted to believe.</i>

MEIA STRIPPED BODYSUIT (temporary full nudity reveal) IN DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nm_m9]: M-Meia! Don't give up yet!<br>Oh, is that...? If you wanted to put that on, we could pretend like we didn't see anything. I'm sure everyone would be okay with that.
Meia [nagisa_resp3s]: They're going to have to be.
  OR [nagisa_resp3s]: A pirate's way of doing things isn't usually welcome.

MEIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED BODYSUIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nm_m8_hand]: You gave us such a surprise. Was that your plan all along?
Meia [nagisa_hand3_resp]: I just don't have many clothes, Nagisa.  And that's not going to stop me from learning more about Earth...
  OR [nagisa_hand3_resp]: I told you, Nagisa...I didn't have a plan.  I barely have any clothes.  That's why I'm stuck doing this...


MEIA MUST STRIP HAT IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_slip]: If I remember right, wasn't there a pink chiffon slip that was part of the angel intimate set? If I had enough money, I'm sure the saleslady would have been able to pressure me into buying it. I didn't want to disappoint her.
Meia [nagisa_resp2cupid]: You need to stand up for yourself sometimes, Nagisa.  That's also part of love.
  OR [nagisa_resp2cupid]: You shouldn't let people push you around like that, Nagisa.  Even if you love them.

MEIA STRIPPING HAT (major but should be accessory) IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [naigsa_meia_insecure]: But what if people stop liking you? How can you make it up to them?
Meia [nagisa_resp23cupid]: ...If you're afraid of not being liked, you might not realize when you <i>are.</i>
  OR [nagisa_resp23cupid]: ...If they really <i>do</i> like you, then they want to see you like <i>yourself.</i>

MEIA STRIPPED HAT (major but should be accessory) IN CUPID OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_angel_advice]: That... that's really good advice. Wow, you really are like an angel, Meia!
Meia []: I had to learn it myself.  You think you're getting out of their way, but they just want you to be happy.
  OR []: It's ironic, but you can be selfish by thinking you're not important.  One of our prisoners made me realize that.


MEIA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_so_calm]: Meia, you still seem so calm despite everything. It's okay if you want to be a little sad.
Meia [nagisa_resp3]: ...What do you mean, Nagisa?  About my bustline?
     [nagisa_resp3]: ...There's nothing to be sad about, Nagisa.  Are you talking about my breasts?

MEIA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_sad_inside]: N-No! I didn't mean about your chest! It's just that if you're feeling sad on the inside because you're already this far, then you don't have to hold is all inside. It wouldn't be fair if we didn't all get to express ourselves.
Meia [nagisa_resp34]: I've been <i>trying</i> to express myself more.  Even by coming here, so I can show--<i>curiosity.</i>
  OR [nagisa_resp34]: I've learned not to hide when I'm sad.  Or <i>any</i> of my feelings.  But what I've held back until now has been--when I'm <i>curious.</i>

MEIA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_showing_yourself]: As long as you're okay... After all, in a game like this, you can only learn about other people by showing them a lot of yourself...
Meia []: I used to sooner show off in a cockpit than "show myself" to others.  I think coming here proves I've grown since.
  OR []: That used to be the one risk I never took.  Look at me now--topless on a hostile planet.


MEIA MUST STRIP SHORTS:
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_body_pride]: I'm sorry if it's not the right time to say this, Meia, but you should be proud of your body. Even if you have to show it all off, we'd never think badly of you.
Meia [nagisa_resp4]: I'm <i>always</i> showing it off, Nagisa.  Did I look any different with my suit on?
  OR [nagisa_resp4]: ...You saw my <i>suit,</i> Nagisa.  Showing off is just what we do.

MEIA STRIPPING SHORTS (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_on_purpose]: Um! Ah, well, what you were wearing before didn't leave a lot to the imagination, that's true... But I had no idea it was on purpose! 
Meia [nagisa_resp45]: ...Well, I---I like how I look.  People always said I was pretty.
  OR [nagisa_resp45]: W-well...I look good, don't I?  Before I came here, I told myself...I feel pretty.

MEIA STRIPPED SHORTS (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_too_proud]: T-That's certainly true. But even if you're already proud of your body, you shouldn't be <i>too</i> proud, right? It's important to be modest.
Meia [nagisa_resp5s]: Pride <i>is</i> one of my bad habits.  But it's a lot worse to just hate yourself.  <br>So...go ahead and stare.
  OR [nagisa_resp5s]: People say pride can go too far, but so can modesty.  You want to take your good points---and feel good about them.

HAND AFTER MEIA STRIPPED SHORTS (holding butt pose):
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nice_butt]: It's... it's nice. I'm just telling you because you can't see it, Meia. Maybe if I had a butt like that, I'd want to show it off too...
Meia [nagisa_nice_butt]: ...There you go again.
  OR [nagisa_nice_butt]: I told you---don't be so modest.

---
DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Meia to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Meia [nagisa0, shyness]: I wouldn't expect a shy schoolgirl to be here.  What are you doing in this kind of place?
  OR [nagisa0, shyness]: ...I don't mean to be rude, but you seem kind of coddled.  How did you end up playing a game like this?
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_big_step]: Oh, me? I don't mind being called that, but I can't stay that way forever. This game is kind of... a big step. Maybe too big.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Meia if at a bar [nagisa01]: This <i>is</i> extreme if you want to be less shy.  Bars always have people who try to take advantage of others.
   OR if non-bar [nagisa01]: You don't need to strip to be mature.  I've spent time in places like this.  We used to heckle the shy ones.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_tough]: I knew it would be tough, but I want to at least try. Thank you for the advice, Meia. I hope we can rely on each other when things get tougher.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Meia [nagisa1s]: ...Sure.  Girls already look to me to stay calm.
  OR [nagisa1s]: ...I guess that's my job, for girls to rely on me.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_reliable]: I can tell. You have a reliable aura about you, you know?


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES IN WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Meia [nagisa_waitress0]: You look cute in that outfit, Nagisa.  Mejare has maid cafés like that, too.
  OR [nagisa_waitress0]: It's been a while since I saw a girl dressed in a maid café outfit.  They exist on Mejare, too...in scattered locations.
  OR [nagisa_waitress0]: ...I can't stay stoic when a sweet girl like you dresses up.  I visited a few maid cafés on my homeworld.
  OR [nagisa_waitress0]: As if we didn't know it was Valentine's Day, Nagisa comes dressed like that...Mejare's maid cafés were packed around this time, too.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_waitress_uniform]: I'm glad my uniform is making you happy, Meia. Have you ever worked at a cafe yourself?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) IN WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Meia [nagisa_waitress01]: ...No, I was too young for that.  I didn't work at all until I joined our crew--the captain even said I was spoiled.
  OR [nagisa_waitress01]: ...Working for our crew has been my only job.  A lot of us grew up being handed everything.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_waitress_independent]: To be honest, this is my first job too. My mom and dad dote on me a little too much, but I'm going to show them how independent I can be!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) IN WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Meia [nagisa_waitress1s]: You have to be your own person eventually.  I didn't get much choice when, but I was already starting to strike out from under mine.
  OR [nagisa_waitress1s]: I did everything I could to be independent.  It's important to take that step...but you should still appreciate them.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_society]: It's all part of making your way in society!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES WITH KYOU AND MEIA SAYING shyness:
Meia [shyness]: [one of any of the above lines that use this marker]
Kyou [kyou_meia_nagisa]: Don't worry, Meia. Nagisa may seem shy but she can be very determined when she wants to be.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_kyou_determined]: That's right! About some things, anyway...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) WITH KYOU AND MEIA ALREADY SAID shyness:
Meia [kyou01nagisa]: ...I'll trust your judgment, then.  "Shy but determined"...I got "loud but aimless" in school.
  OR [kyou01nagisa]: ...Is that so?  Girls had the opposite impression of me in school.
Kyou [kyou_meia_nagisa2]: I'm sure there's a lot more to you than meets the eye... Just like Nagisa.
  OR [kyou_meia_nagisa2]: Did these people ever meet you... "Loud" isn't exactly how I picture you in your school years.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_kyou_grown_women]: We're not in school right now. We can be grown women and do whatever we want to do! Um, but tell me if you see a teacher, Kyou.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) WITH KYOU AND MEIA ALREADY SAID shyness:
Meia [nagisa1s_kyou]: ...A few years ago, I decided actions spoke louder than words.
  OR [nagisa1s_kyou]: ...When I joined our crew, I realized I couldn't prove myself with just talk.
Kyou []*: ??
Nagisa []*: ?? -- falls back to default line, as Kyou has nothing more to say on this.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS: equal priority with block below
Meia [nagisa1]: You're better settled in now, aren't you?  I don't get much practice talking to civilians.
  OR [nagisa1]: I hope you're starting to feel more confident.  I'm not used to giving girls all day to prepare themselves.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_got_here_early]: Well, I haven't had to do much yet, but I think I'll be okay. It helped that I got here a little bit early to get used to this place before we started.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Meia [nagisa12]: That would've been <i>my</i> advice--go early and scout ahead.  I do the same thing for my squadron.
  OR [nagisa12]: That's good instinct.  I always fill downtime by scouting ahead of our ship.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_scouting]: But what if you saw the enemy while you were scouting? Wouldn't that be awkward? Um, not that I mean that you're my enemy or anything...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Meia [nagisa2s]: I report it to the bridge and turn back.  I've only been captured once, when it was a loner hiding in a comet trail.
  OR [nagisa2s]: It's easy to spot them and retreat.  The one time I was captured was my own fault--bad visibility and a lone straggler.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_loner]: Even if he was lonely, that's no excuse for capturing you!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS: equal priority with block above
Meia [nagisa1_alt]: We have a reputation back home, but as a member of Magno's Family, we don't mean you any harm.
  OR [nagisa1_alt]: If you're worried about us, Magno's Family doesn't target civilians.  We recruit them.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_mn_n4_alt]: Where I'm from, we call it the Big Dango Family, but I'm not surprised that they're popular even on other planets. How many are in your version, Meia? Our one has a hundred of them all working hard to make their way through life. And they're so cute!

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Meia [nagisa12_alt]: Uh...our crew is about 150.  Plus more back on Mejare.
  OR [nagisa12_alt]: ...What?  There's---150.  On our ship, at least.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_mn_n5_alt]: You must have so much fun playing with them, Meia! If I joined the Big Magno Family, I don't think I'd ever get any work done, hehehe!

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Meia [nagisa2s_alt]: N-no, I'm---usually alone.  I haven't appreciated them like I should.
  OR [nagisa2s_alt]: I---took them for granted, actually.  Always keeping to myself.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_mn_n6_alt]: You should invite me aboard sometime. I want to play with the grandma one and the baby one and the one that looks up at the moon.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS AND NAGISA ALREADY SAID nagisa_playing_with_boys (one or more males):
Meia [nagisa1boys]: When it comes to men, you seem especially shy.  I guess I figured Earth girls were all used to them.
  OR [nagisa1boys]: I guess growing up around men doesn't mean you'll be confident around them.  It seems to bother you, too.
  OR [nagisa1boys]: I pictured Earth girls stripping around men the same way we'd do with each other.  Maybe some shyness is just instinct.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_lots_of_men]: I do know lots of men. That's true. But, um... I don't... I don't normally take my clothes off for them...

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor) AND NAGISA ALREADY SAID nagisa_playing_with_boys (one or more males):
Meia [nagisa12boys]: Neither do we.  I think a lot of us are still worried about their germs.
  OR [nagisa12boys]: Some of our crew started covering up a lot more when the men came aboard.  They didn't want to catch anything.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_germy_boys]: Boys can be extra germy when they're growing up, but when they're older, then it's even more embarrassing if they see you without your clothes on. I'm not really very confident about my body, so...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor) AND NAGISA ALREADY SAID nagisa_playing_with_boys (one or more males):
Meia [nagisa2s_boys]: You look fine.  Most girls have <i>something</i> they don't like about their bodies.
  OR [nagisa2s_boys]: You're just insecure.  No one thinks their body is perfect.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_disappointment_ahead]: That's true. It's just that if any boy got too excited about me, they'd just be even more disappointed later...


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET: Sanako only chimes in if present
Meia [nagisa2]: It sounds like you spent a lot of time with your parents.  Do you treat each other well?
  OR [nagisa2]: The way you talk about them, you seem close to your parents.  Is that right?
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_close_family]: My family is really close. They're so good to me, even though I'm a bit of a burden on them.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Meia [nagisa23]: That's just what parents do.  I was always causing mine trouble, getting in fights or even yelling at them.  But they still loved me.
  OR [nagisa23]: ...That's part of being a parent.  They love you through all your mistakes, or your arguments, or even getting hurt.  You can't have been worse than I was.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_forgive]: I think it's really sad when someone is estranged from their parents. Just like they forgive us, we should forgive them when we can too.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Meia [nagisa3s]: ...It took me some time to learn that.  Don't wait until they're already gone to say so.
  OR [nagisa3s]: You might not realize that until you're already separated.  And you wish you could thank them in person.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_telling_tomoya]: That's what I keep telling him!
Sanako [sanako_nagisa_meia_telling_tomoya]: Keep telling who, Nagisa? A friend of yours?


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Meia [nagisa3]: It must have been hard falling ill in school.  I was always running around, playing sports and fighting other girls.
  OR [nagisa3]: Ill health is one problem I've never had.  Even as a girl, I was full of energy, always getting dirty.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_keeping_warm]: I hate missing classes. I love my school so much. I find that it helps if I keep warm. But I... um...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Meia [nagisa34]: ...What's the matter?  Are you sick <i>now?</i>
  OR [nagisa34]: ...Do you not feel well?
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_getting_colder]: N-No! I'm fine. It's just that... it's just that I'm about to get a lot colder, that's all...

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Meia [nagisa4s]: I see.  <br>...It's weird hearing someone say they <i>liked</i> school.  Fights were always a good excuse for me to get out of it.
  OR [nagisa4s]: ...Oh.  <br>And you <i>like</i> school?  I was <i>happy</i> to miss classes sometimes--usually for fighting.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_fights]: There are a couple of students that get into fights at my school too, but it's not because they're bad people. I never considered that they might just be trying to skip classes...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Meia [nagisa4]: The "Big Dango Family" is a plush line, right?  The kind of thing they make pillows out of.
  OR [nagisa4]: One of our bridge operators has a whole collection of plush dolls and costumes.  That's what the "Big Dango Family" is, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_dango_family]: Yeah, you can get dango plushies! But you can also get all kinds of products with them on! My mom bought be a Big Dango Stationery set for my birthday a few years ago. They're so cute, and they have a really great theme song!

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Meia [nagisa45]: I stopped playing with dolls pretty quickly.  But other girls keep them around even as adults.
  OR [nagisa45]: I threw my dolls away pretty quickly as a girl, but they're still popular with a lot of crew members.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_dango_all_ages]: I-It's not just for kids! The Big Dango Family are loved by Japanese people of all ages!

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Meia [nagisa5s]: It's not a bad thing.  Our <i>crew</i> tries to be a big family--and that means accepting everyone.  Even men.
  OR [nagisa5s]: We're called Magno's Family for a reason.  We don't reject people for not fitting in.  We even came around on the men.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_acceptance]: I'd like to think the Big Dango Family would accept me as I am. Maybe even your crew would... ~player.ifMale(Maybe even... a boy... someday.|Girls are so much easier to get along with than boys.)~


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Meia [nagisa5]: ...Have you spent time dating anyone, Nagisa?  Male or female.
  OR [nagisa5]: Friendships are one thing.  Have you had a girlfriend in school?  Or a--<i>boyfriend.</i>
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_confession]: N-No, I haven't done anything like that. Nobody's confessed to me before, not a girl and especially not a boy. Meia, you're not... you're not confessing to me now, are you?!

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Meia [nagisa56]: I'm not.  But what about <i>you</i> confessing to someone?
     [nagisa56]: No.  But you don't have to wait for someone to confess.  You can tell them how <i>you</i> feel.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_the_limit]: I could never do that! W-Well... that is... I'm already pushing myself as much as I can right now... What I mean is, wouldn't it be way too risky to leave myself open like that?

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Meia [nagisa6s]: ...I used to think like that.  If I never trusted anyone, I'd never get hurt.  But it isn't worth it.
  OR [nagisa6s]: ...It's easier to close yourself off.  But that just leaves you with nothing.  I would know.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_heart]: As embarrassing as it is to show so much skin, I know it had to be even harder for you to show your heart like that, Meia. I can't promise I'll do that, but... I'll try.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Meia [nagisa6]: ...Nagisa.  You may be embarrassed, but I'd never laugh at someone for showing their true self.
  OR [nagisa6]:  It takes a lot of courage for someone to show who they really are.  If you're worried we'll make fun of you... <i>I</i> won't.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_unsure]: But... am I really a person who can do this? I thought I could, and now... Now I'm not so sure..

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Meia [nagisa67]: I have a trainee who's always asking herself things like that.  If she's good enough to be a pilot, or has the nerve to face our enemies.
  OR [nagisa67]: ...Dita's always second-guessing herself, too.  Our trainee.  She's not a fierce or a talented person, but she tries her best.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_not_second-guessing]: I won't second-guess myself anymore! I'm sorry!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Meia [nagisa7s]: ...It's hard to imagine her as a pilot, but she <i>does</i> it.  I think you're both stronger than you realize.
  OR [nagisa7s]: ...You <i>remind</i> me of Dita.  She's sweet and always wants everyone to feel better.  And she doesn't run from her fears.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_did_it]: Maybe you're right. I never thought I could do that! But I did it. Now I just think I could never do it again...

---

MEIA MUST STRIP HEADPIECE:
Meia [nagisa_resp0right]: ...My turn.  I'll keep this simple--<i>poker</i> hasn't changed.
  OR [nagisa_resp0right]: ...It looks like poker's still the same game our quartermaster plays.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_poker_in_space]: Oh, do you have poker in space too, Meia? How do you stop the cards from floating away?
 
MEIA STRIPPING HEADPIECE (accessory):
Meia [nagisa_resp01right]: ...Artificial gravity.
  OR [nagisa_resp01right]: We have gravity control, just like pressure and temperature.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_gravity_chaos]: Oh, right. But if the gravity turned off, it would be chaos!

MEIA STRIPPED HEADPIECE (accessory):
Meia [nagisa_resp1s_right]: It doesn't take much power.  By the time the plating failed, we'd all be dead, anyway.
  OR [nagisa_resp1s_right]: It's designed to be the last system that fails.  We'd just be floating bodies by then.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_no_to_space]: ... I don't think I want to visit space anymore. I'll just stick to the planetarium.


MEIA MUST STRIP ARMOR:
Meia [nagisa_resp1right]: ...I remember shouting about this game's rules when I joined our crew.  It was easier to fight than play a bad hand.
  OR [nagisa_resp1right]: ...Me again.  It's weird to think how even games used to annoy me, let alone what my parents said.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_getting_along]: But isn't it more fun when we all get along? Even if that means we lose sometimes too.

MEIA STRIPPING ARMOR (minor):
Meia [nagisa_resp12right]: I can't <i>stand</i> losing, Nagisa.  Or sitting idly by.  I think that's why our quartermaster used to make me play.
  OR [nagisa_resp12right]: I didn't want to get along, Nagisa.  I wanted to stand out and prove myself.  I could do that in a Dread, but our quartermaster knew poker was another story.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_winning]: I think it's so wonderful that you're willing to give it your all! Your quartermaster is a smart lady, because learning how to lose is an essential skill. Even though you might not win to~background.time~, nobody truly leaves here with nothing. Or at least that's what they tell me.

MEIA STRIPPED ARMOR (minor):
Meia [nagisa_resp2s_right]: I know--it's about understanding your opponents.  Like how you trust what people say.
  OR [nagisa_resp2s_right]: It's a social game.  Control your feelings and learn about the other players.  <br>...You take everyone at their word.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_read_book]: You can read me like a book, Meia! But I think I'm getting a better idea of where you're coming from too.

MEIA HAND DURING STAGE 2 (STRIPPED ARMOR)
Meia [nagisa_nudesuit_right]: ...I have underwear, by the way.  Just not <i>underneath.</i>
  OR [nagisa_nudesuit_right]: ...If you're thinking my suit all looks like one piece, it's because it is.  I'll go grab my underwear when I need it.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_nudesuit_right]: That's your decision to make, I suppose. I normally just keep my underwear under my clothes... or in my underwear drawer. 


MEIA MUST STRIP BODYSUIT:
Meia [nagisa_resp2right]: ...This was starting to stick, anyway.  Now I can get some training done.
  OR [nagisa_resp2right]: <i>...Mm---</i>I brought some gym clothes in case this happened.  It'll be good to stay moving.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_sweating]: You must be much more active than I am, Meia. I try not to break a sweat if I can help it, but that can be difficult when I'm nervous.

MEIA STRIPPING BODYSUIT (major):
Meia [nagisa_resp23right]: I know you're a civilian, but it's still good to exercise.  It's--how I <i>ease</i> tension.
  OR [nagisa_resp23right]: Exercising <i>helps</i> me when I'm nervous.  It's not like it's only good for fighters to do it.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_inactive]: Oh! You're already, um... What was I saying? I'm... I'm not really able to be too active. B-But maybe that's why you seem so confident. It's because you know you're the best you can be...

MEIA STRIPPED BODYSUIT (major):
Meia [nagisa_resp3s_right]: I can always be better.  So I know it's always there for me.  What do <i>you</i> do with those feelings?
  OR [nagisa_resp3s_right]: There's no such thing.  That's why I like it, to always improve.  If I didn't have that...well, what's <i>your</i> go-to?
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_negative_feelings]: I normally just keep negative feelings to myself until I get really sad...


MEIA MUST STRIP BRA:
Meia [nagisa_resp3right]: ...This isn't some bust reveal.  Losing my <i>armor</i> did that.
  OR [nagisa_resp3right]: You can tell how modest I am.  Going <i>topless</i> was taking my armor off.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_bra_secrets]: A bra can still keep some of a girl's secrets, even if they're not big secrets. Oh! Not that I'm saying you have little secrets, Meia! They're perfectly normal secrets! I'm sure they're lovely...

MEIA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Meia [nagisa_resp34right]: <i>Nagisa...</i><br>...Well, they don't sag, at least.  And it's good for combat.
  OR [nagisa_resp34right]: ...I know what you meant, Nagisa.  On the plus side, they're perky, and easy to fight with.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_dangerous]: I never even thought about if mine would be good for combat... You're in such great shape, but I keep forgetting that it's because your job is so dangerous! I hope you can find some time to relax, even if that isn't right now...

MEIA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Meia [nagisa_resp4s_right]: ...You know, it's kind of relaxing to <i>talk</i> to you.  To meet new people.  And to show them--who I am.
  OR [nagisa_resp4s_right]: ...I actually feel pretty relaxed.  Talking with you, in this game.  We've got nothing to hide.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_meeting]: I feel the same way! Meeting you and talking to everyone is really getting me through this. But to make it easier, I'm trying to imagine everyone with clothes on...

MEIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED BRA:
Meia [nagisa_clothes]: ...Don't you <i>like</i> my body, Nagisa?  It's not much different with the suit on. 
  OR [nagisa_clothes]: ...Putting my <i>clothes</i> on wouldn't change much, you know.  Don't I look good naked?
  OR [nagisa_clothes]: ...I'd rather you liked me naked than imagined me in my clothes, Nagisa.  Not that it would matter.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_pretty_undressed]: Ah! No, I didn't mean it that way, Meia! You look very pretty, even when you're like that!


MEIA MUST STRIP SHORTS:
Meia [nagisa_resp4right]: This is it.  You know, girls tell me I seem older than twenty.  <br>...Do you think I look that way?
  OR [nagisa_resp4right]: ...Most of our crew is around my age, but everyone says I seem older.  I hope they don't mean my body.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_wise]: Maybe it's because you're wise beyond your years? I know I'm a couple of years younger, but most of the girls in my class just want to go shopping and to the arcade. Oh, Meia! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you lost...

MEIA STRIPPING SHORTS (revealing crotch):
Meia [nagisa_resp45right]: I've never liked those things, even if the others wish they could go back to them.  Maybe I was always meant to be a pirate.
  OR [nagisa_resp45right]: My crewmates <i>would</i> be doing that if they could.  I'd still have ended up fighting somehow.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_missed_out]: You can't give up yet! There's still lots of things you can still do while you're young. Um, but not right now, because you should have clothes on while you do them...

MEIA STRIPPED SHORTS (revealed crotch):
Meia [nagisa_resp5s_right]: ...Lately, I've been thinking about the things I can do <i>naked.</i>  [REMINDER THAT THIS USES A BUTT POSE]
  OR [nagisa_resp5s_right] ...I came here because I've done everything I can with clothes <i>on.</i>  It's time I took them off.
Nagisa if still dressed [nagisa_meia_naked_bath]: I-I don't know much about stuff like that, Meia. Unless you mean taking a bath. With... with another person?
Nagisa if nude [nagisa_meia_naked_walk]: It <i>would</i> be kind of exciting to walk around the house nude. Ah, I mean as long as the shop was closed and nobody else was home!

MEIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED SHORTS (nagisa said nagisa_meia_naked_bath)
Meia [nagisa_bath]: ...With a <i>man.</i>  I didn't have the nerve to let one see me in the bath.  So I'll go a step further.
  OR [nagisa_bath]: ...I hate how ashamed I felt when a man saw me just <i>approaching</i> the bath.  I need to go a step further somehow, to make up for that...
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_naked_bath_2]: A step further than being with a man in the bath... L-Like a mixed bathing hot springs? You're so daring, Meia.

MEIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED SHORTS (nagisa said nagisa_meia_naked_walk)
Meia [nagisa_walk]: ...It'd be exciting to walk nude, right in front of a man.  Then, <i>touch</i> him, then--the final step.
  OR [nagisa_walk]: ...No.  I want someone else there--a man.  And I want to prove to myself I can take the final step.
Nagisa [nagisa_meia_naked_walk_2]: T-The final step?! M-Maybe you should get to know this man you're taking about first, Meia!


--- Removed exchange
N: I heard that astronauts have to wear diapers when they're in their suits. But I can tell that's not true for you, Meia. I don't think so, at least. It's not, is it?

M: That sounds like very old space travel, Nagisa.  Life on our ship is a lot like a planet's surface.  That includes bathrooms.
M: It's not, Nagisa.  Ships have had things like gravity and bathrooms for as far back as I know.

N: I don't think I'd want to live in the bathroom all day, but sometimes I go there if I'm feeling sad.

M: If you mean to be alone, there's usually someone else in ours.
