    <description>A graduate from Motosu High School in Yamanashi, Nadeshiko Kagamihara is a passionate camper, having fallen in love with it after meeting her friend Rin Shima when she fell asleep on the way to see Mount Fuji. She's now gone on more camping trips than she can count. Her love for the outdoors, and eating in the outdoors, has never been stronger.</description>
