    <othernotes>Felix "Ferris" Argyle - フェリックス・アーガイル&lt;br&gt;Birthday: January 16th&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summary:&lt;br&gt;- Crossdressing knight who uses water magic to heal. Is referred to one of the best healers in the world, but has little to no physical strength (top 5 weakest re:zero characters physically). Has a strong love for his superior, Crusch Karsten, and will commonly comment on her as he looks up to her a lot. Is teasing and sarcastic, but has strong morals and views on death itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Targetable Qualities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physical:&lt;br&gt;- Felix has fair skin and flax-colored hair. He also has orangey-yellow colored eyes, and rounded eyebrows.&lt;br&gt;- Despite all appearances, Felix is male. He is male in "body and soul", quoted by himself.&lt;br&gt;- Because of his master, Crusch Karsten, fufilling the more masculine role between them, he wears feminine clothes. Crusch has also stated that this looks particiularly good on him.&lt;br&gt;- He has a skinny and athletic build, and is average height, standing at 172 cm (5'8"). &lt;br&gt;- In his main outfit, Felix is shaved. However, in his alternative outfit (when it comes out), he has a small patch of pubic hair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clothes:&lt;br&gt;- Felix does not wear a bra or underwear in his main costume. Instead, he wears tights, which show an outline later on in the game.&lt;br&gt;- He wears an elegant blue dress with a gigantic white bow tied on the back. Below that, he wears another more comfortable dress. &lt;br&gt;- Felix wears his collar and head ribbons all game, even after forfeit.&lt;br&gt;- His stripping order is: Shoes &gt; Socks &gt; Armbands &gt; Overdress &gt; Dress &gt; Tights&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personality:&lt;br&gt;- Teasing. Before all, Felix is very playful, and enjoys being mischevious and agitating. &lt;br&gt;- He occassionally refers to himself in the 3rd person and also sometimes uses female pronouns (Ferri-chan)&lt;br&gt;- Felix enjoys seeing the reaction to people who don't know he's a guy&lt;br&gt;- Despite his surface level annoyance, he has a strong view on death, ghosts, and particularly weak people, even going so far to hate them. He also holds a strong hatred to suicide and suicidal people, causing deep contempt.&lt;br&gt;- Sometimes, Felix will pretend to be innocent and embarrassed in a way to act cutesy, or agitate someone intentionally&lt;br&gt;- He holds strong love towards his master, Crusch, even to the extent of an obsession. However, he is not afraid to betray her if she does something out of line or irredeemable.&lt;br&gt;- He flirts commonly, but the only real loyalty he holds is to his master.&lt;br&gt;- In later stages, he progressively becomes more seductive (specifically stage 5-6 and 7-8)&lt;br&gt;- He will act flirtier to men due to being surrounded by them as a Knight. To women, he's usually afraid of overstepping his boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Targeting Topics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serious:&lt;br&gt;- Obsession and devotion. How far are you willing to go for someone you love?&lt;br&gt;- To add onto above, you can call out his obsession or criticize how he lives solely for her&lt;br&gt;- Death and morality, along with ghosts, funerals, revival via necromancy, zombies&lt;br&gt;- Racism (not irl racism) and/or being looked down upon for a certain animal feature&lt;br&gt;- Mistreatment, abuse due to things you can't control&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;General:&lt;br&gt;- Fashion, crossdressing, expressing gender with clothes and defying gender norms--specifically tomboys and crossdressing males&lt;br&gt;- Healing magic and the limits of healing (for example, Felix can't heal mental ailments)&lt;br&gt;- Magic in general, elemental magic, different types of magic or magic systems (like Devil Fruit, Cursed Energy from Jujutsu Kaisen, Nen from Hunter x Hunter)&lt;br&gt;- Knight duties and royalty in general, like princesses&lt;br&gt;- Advanced senses (hearing, smell, taste, eyesight). He mentions his advanced senses early on in the game, but you can further talk about them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexual:&lt;br&gt;- Turning his obsession for Crusch into lust&lt;br&gt;- Repressed fantasies and horny urges due to being put into the Knight's at a young age&lt;br&gt;- Exploring his lack of feminine female attention--he spends the most time with Crusch, who is a masculine woman, and isn't used to hanging around any other mature women&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not so Good Targeting Topics:&lt;br&gt;- "What weapon do you use?" He rarely uses weapons.&lt;br&gt;- "What do you do?" He's a healer and a knight. &lt;br&gt;- "Who is Crusch-sama?" He explains this early on in-game.&lt;br&gt;- "Why do you dress femininely?" Because Crusch told him to. (This can be good if it's more specific)&lt;br&gt;- "Why do you call yourself Ferris and Ferri-chan?" I don't honestly know this, so I couldn't answer with a canonical response&lt;br&gt;- Questions about transgenderism and being a trans girl for the sole fact of not wanting to spark any discourse. I'm not transgender myself, so I couldn't answer with a good response&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Character Notes:&lt;br&gt;- Felix will get his knight costume in the future.&lt;br&gt;- If you want to target one of the topics Felix mentions in his stripping order, each branch has a marker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OOC Notes:&lt;br&gt;- Please refer to Felix as Ferris in targets, as that's his label ingame.&lt;br&gt;- DM me to set up indepth targets! Remillia#1347&lt;br&gt;- I'm fine with targets that are darker in nature and include themes of incest, murder or obsession, but please DM me beforehand so we can discuss limits (this is supposed to be a fun game, after all!)</othernotes>

        <line> I've thought this since he first dropped, but I just plain think Felix talking about Crusch comes too early in the game. I've never much liked the "oh yeah, I should tell you about X important character" thing characters do when they need to exposit. As such, I would ask you to swap the subjects of Felix's first and second strips; have him talk about his magic when he first strips, and Crusch when he does it again. ✔️ 2/16/2023</line>
        <line>Felix strikes me as having the same issues I had with Eichi; he tends to be long-winded in a way he doesn't really need to be, particularly in his hand quality and self-stripping lines. It's tempting to explain exactly what you mean with every line, but too much text can exhaust and bore the reader. Brevity is the soul of wit, and all that. I've submitted bug and feedback reports marked with an asterisk related to this issue. Please address all of them. In the future, I encourage you to be conscious of this; don't be afraid to let the reader fill in the blanks. ✔️ 2/16/2023</line>
        <line>Please add six lines for when Felix is masturbating and there is a dominant character in the game. ✔️ 2/16/2023</line>
        <line>Please add four lines for the Paris Rooftop background anywhere. ✔️ 2/16/2023</line>
        <line>Variety is the spice of life, so add ten lines to his After Finished (Self) generics. ✔️ 2/16/2023</line>
        <line>He only has 1 real problem, he doesn't talk enough with other characters and doesn't really respond to special things that happen. Add 65 targeted lines, these can go anywhere you want.</line>

        <line>AE68 = 12</line>
        <line>Add more lines for when someone strips and reveals their underwear. I got the same line for all 3 characters. At least 4 new lines for this. ✔️ 3/1/2023</line>
        <line>Have at least 10 lines for Kazuma’s Halloween outfit. Because it’s a Halloween outfit nobody writes lines for it, which is a shame because it’s the only reason I play him. I also think there’s a lot of opportunities for dialogue here with Felix being a femboy. Some of them should be him simply reacting to when Kazuma upskirts himself.</line>
        <line>Have at least 1 line for 10 different backgrounds. ✔️ 3/1/2023</line>
        <line>• The Kisekae-default-looking genitalia are a little jarring in comparison to the rest of the model. Please make custom ones that are a little more in line with the rest of him. ✔️ 3/30/2023</line>
        <line>• He's talking about a lot of stuff I don't understand. Please add at least 50 more lines unrelated to his source material! At least 25 of these should be generic lines.= ✔️ 4/09/2022</line>
        <line>Fix all lines with text obscured behind the head. (Any “character is talking so much there is a whole wall of text behind them” gag lines are okay, if you ever decide to write them.) ✔️ 4/09/2022</line>
        <line>Make the “So, I’m gonna guess you’re all curious about the Crusch-sama I keep mentioning!” line dependent on a marker that tracks whether Ferris has actually mentioned Crusch or not. I did a Ctrl+F for “Crusch” when I got this line in my game, and the only appearance before this particular line was internal dialogue: “&lt;i&gt;(What would Crusch-sama do in this situation?)&lt;/i&gt;”. You could also delete the line and rewrite it if you want, but who wants that? ✔️ 4/09/2022? </line>
        <line>Respond to Chihiro Fujisaki’s Must-Target situations (or write me a 100+-word essay on why you don’t want to). ✔️ 4/09/2022</line>
